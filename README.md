SECTION A 
 
Answer all the items from this section 
Item 1. 
A brass band was invited to play during a celebration near a tall building, a distance 
slightly more than 17 m away. Two friends standing in the same direction and in 
line with the playing band, heard the sound from the band at different intervals of 
time which attracted them to go and attend the celebration. On arrival, the sound 
they heard was unclear, confused and indistinct. Later in the night during the 
cerebration, coloured lights flashing red, blue and green made the colours of their 
clothes look different from the original colours which puzzled them. 
 
Hint: Speed of sound in air = 330 ms-1. 
 
The two friends heard sound after 4 s and 5 s, respectively. 
The friends were originally wearing yellow clothes. 
 
Task: 
 
As a physics student, help the two friends to understand why; 
 
(a) they heard the sound at different intervals. 
 
(b) the sound they heard was unclear, confused and indistinct. 
 
(c) the colour of their clothes kept changing when coloured lights flashed on 
  them. 
Item 2. 
 
In a certain town, people are concerned about the waste disposal from the factory 
into the nearby lake which is their source of water for home use. They raised this 
issue to the chairperson Local Council 1 (LC1) who directed the management of 
the factory to stop disposing waste into the lake. A scientist was contacted to 
investigate the presence of radioactive material in the water. The scientist found out 
that the water was indeed radioactive as shown in Table 1. 
 
  Table 1 
Time/days 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 
Activity/counts 
per minute 1200 740 440 260 160 90 60 
 
Although the water from the lake remains radioactive for a long time, the scientist 
recommended that water will be safe for use again when the activity is less than 38 
counts per minutes. 
 
Task: 
 
As a student of physics; 
 
(a) Advise the chairperson LC1 about the time the community will wait for the 
  water to be safe for use again. 
 
(b) Sensitise the members of the community about the risks associated with  
 radioactive materials and how such materials should be handled. 
Item 3. 
In a certain country, a Television (TV) reporter was reporting live near the ocean 
about the high tides during night time. Viewers in another country were watching 
the live broadcast of the news bulletin during day time. The viewers wondered how 
it could be day and night at the same time, and how the event in one country could 
be watched live on TV in another country. 
Task 
Using your knowledge of physics to help the viewers to understand;  
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
Item 4. 
the possibility of it being day in one place and night in another  
place. 
the occurrence of high ocean tides. 
how an event in one place can be broadcast live in another 
country. 
SECTION B 
PART 1 
Answer one item from this part 
A certain home owner intends to put up a metallic tank of height 4 m with a 
maximum volume of 5000 l fitted with an electrical heater which supplies  
20,000 kJ of heat energy as shown in figure 1. 
TurnOver 
3 
The home owner found out that the heater was fitted at the lower part of the tank 
but he did not understand why it was done like that. Just before the hole for the 
outlet pipe was drilled at point A, the home owner told the person with the drill that 
the correct position was either B or C.  
Task:  
As a learner of Physics; 
(a) Explain to the home owner why; 
(i)  
the electrical heater was fitted at the lower part of the tank and  
how eventually all the water gets hot. 
(ii) 
the outlet pipe was drilled at point A. 
(b) If the initial temperature of the water in the tank is 20 oC, help 
the home owner to find out if the heater is working. 
(c) Advise the home owner on measures that can be taken to ensure that 
the  
tank stand can withstand the weight of the tank and water for a 
long time.  
Use: 
Density of water        
= 1000 kgm-3. 
Specific heat capacity of water = 4200 J kg-1 K-1. 
Acceleration due to gravity       
Item 5 
Task: 
Having studied physics; 
(a)  
= 10 ms-2 
A certain hotel has its bathrooms situated on the 3rd floor of a building.  
A customer of the hotel expects to bathe water at 32 oC. The hotel provides  
10 litres of water at 20 oC to each customer. A boiler on ground floor heats water to 
80 oC for the customers to use. The hotel management does not allow its workers to 
carry the hot water via the staircase. 
help the hotel management to determine the  
quantity of hot water to  
be given to a customer for bathing. 
(b) advise the hotel management on how to keep the boiled water hot for  
a long period of time without keeping the boiler on.  
(c)    explain to the management how the water from the boiler can reach 
the third floor safely. 
Use: 
Density of water = 1000 kgm-3. 
Specific heat capacity of water = 4200 J kg-1 K-1. 
Acceleration due to gravity      
= 10 ms-2

Item 6. 
PART II 
Answer one item from this part. 
Small pieces of metal which are unsafe to be eaten by chicken were found in feeds 
that had just been bought from a milling company by a poultry farmer. The small 
pieces of metal were later identified as iron. The farmer thought of disposing off 
the feeds but remembered that the pieces of metals could be sorted with a magnet 
which he did not have.  
Hint:  
A nail, connecting wires of resistance 0.5 Ω, two dry cells each of 1.5 V were 
available to the farmer. 
Task: 
As a student of physics; 
(a) 
(b) 
Help the farmer to remove the pieces of iron from the feeds. 
Comment on the  effectiveness of what you have designed, given that current  
of 4 A is enough to create a strong magnet. 
Item 7. 
Task: 
In a certain place, electricity is transmitted at 120 V. A business person intends to 
connect 4 bulbs in a house rated 240 V, 60 W each, and other domestic electrical 
appliances such that there is minimum power wastage.  The business person has 
been advised to purchase a transformer of suitable specifications to achieve the 
objectives. The business person does not know what a transformer is, how it works 
and is bothered by the type of transformer that should be purchased. 
As a student of physics, help the business person to solve the problems he/she is 
faced with.
